/**
 * ProUpsellModal — shown when a Community Edition user clicks a Pro-Edition-
 * only UI surface. Replaces the historic "hide on Community Edition" behavior
 * with show-and-explain so users see the value of upgrading instead of
 * silently missing controls.
 *
 * The same compiled binary serves Pro Edition backends (e.g. VaultGuard Cloud)
 * and Community Edition self-hosts; Pro Edition backends never open this modal
 * because their featureEnabled() returns true at the call sites.
 *
 * The modal opens with a prominent "PRO FEATURE — Not available in Community
 * Edition" badge above the title; banner classes are styled in styles.css.
 *
 * No URLs in the copy: the public-plugin export scrubber rewrites the hosted
 * production domain to a placeholder (scripts/export-public-plugin-repo.mjs
 * DOMAIN_REPLACEMENTS), which would leave nonsensical text in the binary
 * shipped to the Obsidian directory if we hard-coded any host name here.
